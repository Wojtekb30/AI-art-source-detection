# AI-art-source-detection
<b>Introduction and goal of the project: </b>

Art made by artificial intelligence is becoming more and more popular. To work, it steals images made by human artists. The AI also mimics their artstyle.

We will not be able to stop development of art artificial intelligence, but we can use AI to reveal truth about images made by it.

The goal of this project is to make a <b>artificial intelligence tool for recognising AI art and whose images were used by it when rendering.</b> This way we will not only let anyone easily tell which art is human-made and which was made by a AI computer program, but we will also reveal whose art was used in the rendering process (which most often happens without any approval from the artist).

When working on this AI we shall never use any art without the artist's approval. This is main rule of this project. \
Preffered programming language: Python.

<b>Status: </b>

Looking for a team - contributors (programmers) and artists willing to cooperate on this project.
